This is a basic work scheduler that can be used immediately upon entering the page. To begin, simply add your own text to the colored text areas next to each hour. Then you can hit the blue save buttons on the right side of the page to save the text to local storage, and have them continuously display even after refreshing the page. The text boxes will change colors as the time changes throughout the day.
